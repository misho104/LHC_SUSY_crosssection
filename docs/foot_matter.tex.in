\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

This paper introduces a Python package ``\texttt{susy\_cross\_section}'' to handle cross-section grid tables provided by various groups in various format.
Users can install it via \texttt{PyPI} to load the grid tables, to get cross-section values by interpolations, and to validate the interpolating function, in an unified manner in their Python codes.
A terminal command ``\texttt{susy-xs}'' is provided, with which users can glance the grid data and cross-section values.
Several grid tables are pre-installed, which are originally calculated and distributed by NNLL-fast collaboration and LHC SUSY Cross Section Working Group.

This package is managed on \href{https://github.com}{GitHub}: \href{https://github.com/misho104/susy_cross_section}{\texttt{misho104/susy\_cross\_section}}.
Bug reports, comments, questions, and contribution are welcome on the website.
